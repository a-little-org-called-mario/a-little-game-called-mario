# Hello
# If you're reading this, then that means you're interested in the DDR mode, and maybe want to create your own levels!
# I've left this as a small tutorial on how to make them
# This file is basically just a list of ticks and poses (up, left, right, down)
# You can also leave comments with the # char, and you should be able to have empty lines
